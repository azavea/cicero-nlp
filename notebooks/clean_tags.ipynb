Kathy Henson Contact Kathy Henson Email: kathy.henson@thorntonco.gov Office: 303-538-7534 Council member, Ward 1 Voting Record I have lived most of my life in Colorado, having grown up in Lakewood and returning to Colorado in the 1998 with my husband, Dennis. We moved to the Ward 1 area of Thornton in 2003 and are raising our two sons here. My professional background is in the performing arts. I have a degree in voice and have worked for decades in theater as a performer, director, choreographer and producer. I have been an education advocate for years, working to ensure that students of all abilities receive the support and fair treatment guaranteed them in our public schools. I am an alum of the Adams 12 Five Star Leadership Academy and currently serve on the Finance and Audit Committee for the district. Before being elected to council, I served on the Thornton Active Adult Board, working in support of updating the master plan for services and recreation opportunities for residents aged 55+. Throughout my life I have volunteered my time and talents at church, serving for years on multiple leadership councils and search committees. I have advocated for the redevelopment of Thornton Shopping Center for several years, working together with Ward 1 residents to bring this need to light.  Revitalization of all south Thornton is a top priority for me. City planning and development throughout Thornton will be key as our city continues to grow. It is a privilege for me to serve our community and it is my goal to work together with my fellow councilors, city staff, community leaders and residents across Thornton to shape a city where all our residents can thrive.
